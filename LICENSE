The Cola's Advanced Rocketry Team gives full permission for anyone to release a modified/spin-off version of this pack on CurseForge only. The modified version must state that it is a modified version of Rebirth of the Night and must link back to the main CurseForge page for Rebirth of the Night in a clear and concise way, without being hidden or difficult to find.

You may modify the pack for your own personal use, but support will not be provided for modified versions. This does not imply that support will always be given for unmodified versions of the pack at all times.

You may not charge people to get access to any modified or unmodified versions that are made. Money through donations such as Patreon is fine, so long as they are purely optional donations that are not reflected in the usage of the project.

You may not charge people for any assets in this project or claim them as your own.

You may not distribute unmodified versions of this project anywhere, unless the original Curseforge page distributing the project has become defunct and the creators of the project have given permission to do so.

All modified/spin-off versions of this project must abide by this same license.
